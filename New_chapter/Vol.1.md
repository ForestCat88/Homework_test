For work with remote repositories in GitHub, we must use a same basic commands:
1. ** git clone [URL] (http://www.github.com/username...) ** - clone outer repositories on local PC
2. ** git pull ** - for transferring your changes to remote repositories
3. ** git push ** - to download changes to your local repositories
